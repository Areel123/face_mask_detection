In my fourth project during my internship, I undertook the task of developing a face mask detection system. Leveraging the comprehensive capabilities of Python, I utilized a range of libraries and tools to create a robust solution. At the core of the project, I employed TensorFlow, a powerful deep learning framework, to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for detecting whether individuals in images are wearing face masks. To enhance the performance and efficiency of the model, I preprocessed the image data using the PIL (Python Imaging Library) and OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) libraries, enabling resizing, conversion, and normalization of images. Moreover, I employed Streamlit, a user-friendly web application framework, to develop an intuitive interface for users to upload images and receive real-time predictions from the trained model. This project not only provided me with hands-on experience in machine learning and computer vision but also allowed me to refine my skills in deploying applications for practical use cases.
